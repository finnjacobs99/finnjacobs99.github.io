		<h4>School Lyfe</h4>
		<p></p>
		<h6>Elementary</h6>
		<p>I first started out in Longfellow Elementary, which is located in Brunswick Maine along with all the other public schools I've attended.
			It was here where I met most of my best friends. Coffin, Jordan Acres, and Hawthorn were the three other elemntary schools in the Brunswick area,
			but Longfellow was obviously ranked number one because we had the best playground. Although we had the best playground, the people who volunteered to
			be on recess duty were power hungry authoritarians. I specifically remember this one lady on recess duty that we all referred to as "The Hockey Lady",
			because she always wore this windbreaker that said Hockey Mom on it, and she was the worst of them all. I naturally was always a rowdy kid which didnt help,
			but she would always find the smallest things to make give me timeout during my precious recess. Hockey Lady if you're reading this, go to hell.
		</p>
		<h6>Junior High</h6>
		<P>I went to Brunswick Junior High School for sixth through eighth grade. I met a lot of new friends from the other elemntary schools during this time
			since all of them merged into the same junior high. The transition from Longfellow to BJHS was great in my mind at the time, because while there were
			still a lot of restrictions, you had a lot more freedom there than when I went to longfellow.
		</P>
		<h6>High school</h6>
		<p>After junior high I went to (you guessed it) Brunswick High School. Just like everyone else, I changed a lot in the four years I was there.
			I broke free from my antisocial habits, expanded my friend groups, and made positive lifestyle changes to myself that improved my quality of life
			greatly. I got my first girlfriend, lost weight, gained a sense of style, and with my still mischievous personality I made plenty of fond memories
			within those brick walls.
